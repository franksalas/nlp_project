        'memo_2':'''Industrial Property Overview
        Blue Industries’s non-traded REIT is currently deploying $500 million/month into multifamily and industrial assets,
        with a focus on assets producing an immediate, steady cash flow with low cost basis.
        
        Typical parameters for the non-traded REIT are as follows:
        * B, B+ market (Atlanta, Baltimore, Phoenix)
        * Prefer to enter a secondary market and use higher leverage
        * 10-11% IRR with 60% leverage
        * 7% cash-on-cash returns
        * 5% net return
        
        Given Blue Industries’s current appetite for industrial product, they are open to a wide range of equity checks
        across primary and secondary markets, and programmatic ventures with proven operators and
        developers.
        
        Blue Industries’s opportunistic fund are far less active right now given the current pricing environment. Return
        metrics in these funds are hard to hit with cost basis where it is for industrial.''',

        * West Coast: consensus seems that as they continue buying and selling in early 2017, they will be

        Charlotte, Nashville, etc. At this point it is only exploratory and they are not ready to pursue new deals
        yet. They are going to focus on Austin first and have asked for our help educating them on the market.

        key. They will continue to develop multi-family in urban locations.
        Office- They feel good about the fundamentals in all of their key markets. They are very focused on
        being in top tier locations with transportation and amenities. They are seeing a lot of major companies
